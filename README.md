<h1 align='center'>CryoSVD</h1>

This repository contains a simple linear pipeline for the analysis of volume series output by heterogeneity software designed for the anlayis of single-particle Cryo-EM samples. It is based on Singular Value Decomposition (Singular Value Decomposition) of a series volumes, as well as an inspection of power power spectrum across the series. 

Details about CryoSVD construction can be found in the associated [publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.07.617120v1)
